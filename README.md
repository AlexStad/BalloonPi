# BalloonPi
This project is made for utilising the Adafruit Ultimate GPS and the RockBlock Iridium Satellite Modem with a Raspberry Pi to send relevant GPS data from a HAB (High Altitude Balloon, also known as Weather Balloon) back to earth and to save extensive GPS Data locally on the Raspberry Pi for retrieval. An additional Script is contained for additionally taking photos with a Raspberry Pi Camera V2.
